# WappSnap

WappSnap is a handy web application screen shot utility. It can ingest Nessus/Nmap XML, flat text files, or a single URL on the command line. 


> **Note**
> WappSnap was inspired by and based upon PeepingTom. I relied on PeepingTom for many years. Out of necessicity I had to make my own updates to keep it working. Over time these changes resulted in a tool that deserved its own repo. It would not be here without PeepingTom.
